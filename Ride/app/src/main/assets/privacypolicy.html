BookMyRide uses this information to fulfil your booking requests, to validate when trips booked via BookMyRide have actually taken place and if they were completed correctly, to provide a log of the trips for safety and security, and to match payments against trip information in case of a credit card or other dispute.<br />BookMyRide also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, BookMyRide cookie information and the page you requested.
